# miniChess

## Project Objectives

This project, developed in 2019 as a university assignment, aims to familiarize with object-oriented programming in Java, specifically focusing on implementing classes that inherit from a base class and utilizing stack data structures.

### Game interface:

### Goals:

1. **Class Development**: Implement classes for each chess piece type (King, Queen, Bishop, Knight, Rook, Pawn) that inherit from a base class (Piece). Also, develop a class for managing the movement history (GestorHistorial).

2. **Chess Piece Movement Logic**: Each chess piece class should incorporate logic to determine valid moves based on the current game state, following simplified movement rules.

3. **User Interface**: The project includes a user interface that visually displays the chessboard and allows players to interact by selecting and moving pieces.

4. **Unit Testing**: Provided unit tests ensure correct implementation of classes and methods. Students need to pass these tests to validate their implementations.

5. **Code Organization**: Students are expected to organize code properly, utilize meaningful variable and method names, include comments, and maintain consistent code indentation.

The project is written in Java and it is compatible with Java 1.8 and JUnit 4.12.
